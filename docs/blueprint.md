## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated blue (#5989CC) for a professional, calming feel without being overbearing.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F9F9F9) to provide a clean and neutral base.
- Accent color: A vibrant, contrasting yellow (#D4AC0D) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for all text elements to maintain a modern, readable, and clean aesthetic. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a clean, grid-based layout with generous whitespace, constrained to a maximum 80% content width to maintain focus and clarity.
- Employ lightweight, line-based icons from a set like Heroicons to complement the minimalist design.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations for interactive elements to provide user feedback without overwhelming the interface.
